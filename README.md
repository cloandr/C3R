# C3R Master Thesis ESEO 

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my master's thesis project. This project represents the culmination of my research and development efforts in creating a connected tibial prosthesis with mobile application integration.


# About C3R

C3R project focuses on the design and development of a connected device integrated into a tibial prosthesis, establishing a seamless connection with a mobile application through Bluetooth technology. The primary goal is to provide an innovative solution for patients who have experienced lower limb amputation. The integrated device plays a pivotal role in enabling these patients to recover and visualize their center of gravity, which is crucial for ensuring precise adjustment of the prosthesis tailored to the patient's unique needs and comfort.

# C3R Showcase Website
- Informative Website: Develop a comprehensive website that educates visitors about the connected tibial prosthesis and its innovative features. The website should provide detailed information about the device, its functionality, and its benefits for amputees.

- Visual Appeal: Create an aesthetically pleasing website that incorporates modern design principles and responsive layouts to ensure that visitors have an engaging and visually satisfying experience.

- Technological Stack: Utilize a technology stack that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a user-friendly, interactive, and dynamic web showcase. The website should offer smooth navigation and quick access to essential information.

- Interactive Elements: Incorporate interactive elements to engage visitors, such as image galleries, animations, and intuitive navigation, making the website more user-friendly.
